# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
At MyOnlineStore B.V. safety and research for safety of our platform are of great importance. Not just for our own safety, but mainly for our merchants and their consumers. Help from outside is welcome, and we encourage the publication of found vulnerabilities, provided that their publication is within reasonable limits and is in consultation with MyOnlineStore B.V..

We have established the following framework:
* We aim to respond to incoming reports within one working day
* Give us a fair and reasonable time to resolve the issue before your results are published elsewhere
* Under no circumstances leak or remove (user) data from MyOnlineStore B.V., its merchants or consumers
* Fraud against and/or threat to MyOnlineStore B.V., its merchants or consumers will not be tolerated under any circumstances. This will be reported to the authorities in all cases
* When in doubt, please contact us first via team-csi@myonlinestore.com

To encourage publication, we promise not to take legal action against researchers who point to a problem, provided they do their best to follow these guidelines.

# Rewards
* Attribution on our Hall of Fame hosted on this page
* Monetary compensation is currently not offered under this program unless otherwise agreed by MyOnlineStore B.V.

# Liability
MyOnlineStore B.V. reserves the right to decide whether the minimum severity threshold has been reached and whether an issue has been previously reported. In general, anything that could potentially cause financial loss or data breach is of sufficient severity, including:
* XSS
* CSRF
* Bypass authentication or escalation of privileges
* Clickjacking
* Implementation of external code
* Obtain user information

In general, the following would not meet the severity threshold:
* Vulnerabilities on sites hosted by third parties, such as Google Analytics, status.myonlinestore.com, feedback.mijnwebwinkel.nl, etc. Unless they lead to vulnerability on the main websites
* Denial of Service and brute force attacks
* Non-ideal but non-exploitable configuration problems
* Spamming or phishing
* Vulnerabilities in third-party applications such as payment providers
* Vulnerabilities in third-party applications that use the MyOnlineStore B.V. API

We do not respond to reported issues that do not comply with these guidelines
